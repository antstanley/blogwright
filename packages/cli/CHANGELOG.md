# blogwright

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`aefd6c8`](https://github.com/antstanley/blogwright/commit/aefd6c8f1edd612f0fdc99eab70e0edc7c65cfab) Thanks [@antstanley](https://github.com/antstanley)! - First changesets-managed release, recapping the 0.1.x line and shipping a real
  package README.

  New in this release:

  - A full getting-started README on the `blogwright` npm package (the npmjs page
    previously showed a three-line stub): requirements, the
    `init` → `bootstrap` → `deploy` path, a command reference, configuration
    with the non-Astro knobs, a copy-paste OIDC CI workflow, and output modes.

  Recap of what 0.1.0 shipped, for the changelog record:

  - **Deploy any static site**: `paths.app`/`paths.dist` for monorepo apps,
    `spa: true` for client-side-routing fallback, and `sourceInclude` for
    pre-built gitignored artifacts (wasm bundles built in CI) — alongside the
    original Astro-shaped defaults.
  - **A CLI that helps**: `blogwright init` first-run wizard, live MicroVM build
    progress, a deploy summary card, `status` as a drift tree, `history` with a
    `← live` marker — pretty on a TTY, stable plain text for CI and agents
    (`--plain`, `NO_COLOR`).
  - **Hexagonal internals**: every side effect behind a port (filesystem,
    terminal, VCS, network), enforced by lint; the standard.site integration
    extracted into `blogwright-pds` with the `blogwright/rkey` contract intact.
  - **A full-project review's worth of hardening**: devDependencies install
    correctly in MicroVM builds, domains added after bootstrap attach to the
    existing distribution, OIDC trust policies reconcile on `githubRepo` change,
    concurrent deploys can no longer destroy the standard.site OAuth session,
    wrong-region S3 responses fail loudly, and JSONC configs accept trailing
    commas.
