blogwright errors try to name their own fix. This page collects the ones you are most likely to meet — what triggers each, why, and what to do — grouped by area. Command and flag details live in the [CLI reference](/reference/cli/); every config key is documented in the [configuration reference](/reference/configuration/).

## Configuration

### `no config found for environment "<env>" — looked for …`

The CLI loads `config/<env>.jsonc` from the repo root of your site, falling back to `ops.config.jsonc`. When you pass `--config <path>`, that file becomes the only candidate. The error lists exactly which paths were tried.

Create the missing file — `siteName` is the only key without a default (`region` falls back to `us-east-1`):

```jsonc
// config/production.jsonc
{
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "siteName": "example" // stable slug in every AWS resource name — never change it
}
```

The environment defaults to `production`, so a bare `blogwright deploy` looks for `config/production.jsonc`. If you meant a different environment, pass it positionally or with `--env`. See [Environments](/guides/environments/).

### `could not find the repo root (no .git or .jj above <dir>)`

blogwright finds the repo root by walking up from the invocation directory to the nearest `.git` or `.jj`, so it works from any subdirectory — but only inside a version-controlled repo. Run it from within your site's repository (or initialize one).

### `config.siteName is required — a stable lowercase slug used in every derived AWS resource name`

Every AWS resource name is derived from `siteName`, so there is no default. Add it to your config and never change it afterwards — a changed `siteName` derives a whole new set of resources.

### Config validation errors

Config is parsed as JSONC (comments and trailing commas are fine), merged over defaults, then validated. Each check throws with the offending key in the message:

- `config.siteName must be lowercase alphanumeric/dashes` — same character rule as environment names.
- `config.region is required` — it defaults to `us-east-1`, so this only fires if you set it to an empty string.
- `config.microvm.memory must be one of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 GB` and `config.microvm.maxDurationSeconds must be in 1..28800` — the builder MicroVM's valid sizing envelope.
- `config retention days must be positive` — both CloudWatch retention values (`retention.microvmDays`, `retention.cloudfrontDays`) must be at least 1.
- `config.seo.robots must be one of auto, index, noindex, off` and `config.seo.sitemap must be one of auto, on, off`.
- `config.sourceInclude entries must be repo-relative without ".."` and `config.paths.<app|dist> must be repo-relative without ".."` — everything zipped or built is addressed relative to the repo root; absolute or escaping paths are rejected.
- `config.pds.name is required`, `config.pds.handleResolver must be a URL` (and `https`), `config.pds.secretName has invalid characters` — only when a `pds` section is present.

Fix the named key; the [configuration reference](/reference/configuration/) documents each one with its default.

### `environment must be lowercase alphanumeric/dashes, got "<env>"`

Environment names feed directly into AWS resource names, so they share the same slug rule as `siteName`. Rename the environment (e.g. `staging`, not `Staging`).

### `derived bucket name "<bucket>" exceeds S3's 63-char limit; shorten env or siteName`

The per-environment bucket is named `<env>-<siteName>-<accountId>`. With a 12-digit account id, that leaves about 50 characters for the env and site name together. Shorten one of them.

### `init is an interactive wizard; in CI or plain mode create config/production.jsonc by hand instead`

`blogwright init` asks questions, so it needs a TTY — it refuses under `--plain`, in CI, or with piped output. Write the config by hand instead; `region` and `siteName` are all it needs:

```sh
echo '{ "region": "us-east-1", "siteName": "example" }' > config/production.jsonc
```

### `<path>/config/production.jsonc already exists — edit it directly, or pass --config elsewhere`

`init` never overwrites an existing config. Edit the file directly — or if you genuinely want a second config, write it by hand and select it with `--config`.

## Bootstrap and teardown

### `certificate not ISSUED (status=…); re-run bootstrap once DNS propagates`

Bootstrapping with a custom domain requests an ACM certificate that must be validated via DNS. blogwright prints the records to add at your registrar (`Add these DNS records at your registrar to validate the certificate:`) and waits up to 30 minutes for the certificate to reach `ISSUED`. If validation hasn't completed in that window, the command fails — add the records, wait for DNS to propagate, and re-run `blogwright bootstrap`. It picks up where it left off. See [Custom domains](/guides/custom-domains/).

For the preview stack the domain must be a Route53 hosted zone, so validation records are created for you and this error usually means DNS was still propagating — just re-run.

### `refusing to destroy "<env>" without --yes`

Destructive operations require explicit confirmation via the `--yes` flag — there is no interactive prompt to fumble in CI. The same guard protects the other irreversible commands:

- `blogwright destroy <env> --yes` — tears down all infrastructure for an environment.
- `blogwright preview teardown --yes` — `refusing to tear down the preview stack without --yes`.
- `blogwright pds secret delete --yes` — `refusing to delete secret "<name>" without --yes` (immediate, no recovery window).

### `<n> MicroVM(s) did not terminate in time; re-run destroy once they clear`

A running builder MicroVM pins the builder image, and deleting a pinned image fails. `destroy` and `preview teardown` therefore list active builder VMs first (`<n> builder MicroVM(s) must be terminated before the image can be deleted:`), offer to terminate them (default yes; non-interactive runs terminate automatically), and wait up to three minutes for them to clear. If they don't clear in time, wait a moment and re-run the destroy — it is safe to repeat.

## Deploy and rollback

### `infrastructure not bootstrapped (missing MicroVM image or exec role); run bootstrap first`

`deploy` (and `rollback`) runs the builder MicroVM recorded in the environment's state. If the state has no builder image or execution role, the environment was never bootstrapped — or was destroyed. Run `blogwright bootstrap` for that environment first. See the [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart/).

### `sourceInclude path "<entry>" is missing or empty — run the pre-deploy build that produces it before deploying`

`sourceInclude` entries are gitignored paths zipped into the deploy source anyway — artifacts a pre-deploy step builds outside the MicroVM (a wasm bundle, generated assets). Each entry must exist and be non-empty at deploy time; a forgotten pre-build fails fast here instead of shipping a broken site. Run the step that produces the artifact, then deploy again. See [Non-Astro sites](/guides/non-astro-sites/).

### `build failed for <hash>: <message>`

The build inside the MicroVM failed — typically a `pnpm install` or `pnpm build` error in your site. The deploy streams the build log as it runs; to see it again afterwards:

```sh
blogwright logs <hash>
```

`blogwright history` lists past deployments with their hashes and statuses. A `build timed out` message means the build exceeded `microvm.maxDurationSeconds` (default 1800) — raise it in config if your build legitimately needs longer.

### `MicroVM launch returned HTTP <code> — retrying in <n>s (a just-updated builder image can lag)`

A warning, not a failure. Right after the builder image is updated (for instance on the first deploy after a blogwright upgrade), the MicroVM control plane can answer 502/503/504 for a short window. The launch retries with backoff over roughly two minutes and is idempotent, so no action is needed unless the retries are exhausted.

### `no build artifact at build/<hash>.zip; cannot roll back to <hash>`

`rollback` re-runs the builder against the source zip a previous deploy uploaded to `build/<hash>.zip`. If no deploy ever uploaded that hash — a typo, or a hash from a different environment — there is nothing to roll back to. Find a valid hash first:

```sh
blogwright history
blogwright rollback <hash>
```

:::note
On production with a `pds` section configured, rollback warns: `rollback does not sync the PDS (records mirror the current repo content)`. The PDS mirrors your working tree, which a rollback does not restore — check out the rolled-back revision and run `blogwright pds sync` if the records should match.
:::

### A metadata fix never reached the live site

A deploy only re-uploads files whose content changed (built file MD5 vs. live object ETag). S3 writes object metadata — content type, object tags — on the PUT, so a metadata-only fix (an upgrade that corrects a content type, or newly added tags) never reaches an unchanged object. Pass `--refresh` once to re-upload every file:

```sh
blogwright deploy --refresh
```

`rollback` and `preview deploy` accept `--refresh` too.

### The whole cache was invalidated (`/*`)

Two log lines explain a full invalidation instead of the usual per-path one:

- `<n> paths changed (> cap) — invalidating everything (/*)` — more paths changed than `invalidationMaxPaths` (default 1000). One `/*` invalidation is cheaper than thousands of path invalidations; raise the cap in config if you'd rather keep per-path behavior.
- `no changed-paths manifest — invalidating everything (/*)` — a warning: the build's changed-paths manifest could not be read, so the deploy invalidates everything to stay correct. Harmless for the site; if it recurs, check the build logs.

An identical redeploy logs `no content changed — skipping CloudFront invalidation` and invalidates nothing.

## Previews

### `preview bootstrap requires a domain (e.g. preview.example.com)`

The shared preview stack serves every PR at `https://<id>.<preview-domain>`, so it cannot exist without a domain. Pass one with `--domain` (or set `domain` in config). The preview domain must be a Route53 hosted zone — the wildcard certificate and DNS records are created automatically. See [PR previews](/guides/pr-previews/).

### `preview id must be lowercase alphanumeric/dashes (e.g. pr-42), got "<id>"`

The preview id becomes a DNS label (`<id>.<preview-domain>`) and an S3 prefix, so it must be lowercase letters, digits, and dashes. `preview deploy` and `preview destroy` also fail when the id is missing entirely (`preview deploy requires an <id> (e.g. pr-42)`, `preview destroy requires an <id>`) — pass it positionally or with `--id`.

### `no Route53 hosted zone found for <domain>`

The preview stack creates its wildcard-certificate validation records and the `*.<domain>` alias in Route53 automatically, which requires the preview domain to be a hosted zone in the same AWS account. Create the hosted zone (and delegate the domain to it) before running `preview bootstrap`.

## standard.site publishing (pds)

The `pds` commands have a strict setup order — keygen, release, login, init, sync — and each error points at the step that was skipped. The full walkthrough is in [Publishing to standard.site](/guides/publishing-standard-site/).

### `config has no "pds" section — add it to config/production.jsonc`

Every `pds` command requires a `pds` section in config; publishing is inert without one. The minimum is a display name:

```jsonc
{
  "pds": { "name": "My Blog" }
}
```

The Secrets Manager secret name defaults to `<siteName>/atproto`.

### `pds keygen requires a configured domain`

`keygen`, `login`, `init`, and `sync` all require a domain (`pds OAuth requires a configured domain`, `pds sync requires a configured domain`, and so on) — the site itself is the OAuth client, and its client id is a URL on your domain. Set `domain` in config or pass `--domain`.

### `no secret at "<name>" — create it with 'blogwright pds keygen'`

No Secrets Manager secret exists yet (or it exists but `secret "<name>" has no OAuth client key`). Run `blogwright pds keygen` — it stores the private key in the secret and writes the two public client documents under `public/oauth/`.

### `https://<domain>/oauth/client-metadata.json is not deployed (HTTP <status>) — commit public/oauth/* and release first`

`login` and `init` first verify that the deployed `/oauth/` documents match what the CLI would send the authorization server — a stale or missing deployment would otherwise fail deep inside the OAuth flow. After `pds keygen`, you must commit `public/oauth/*` and deploy before logging in. The sibling error, `… does not match the local client configuration`, means the deployed documents are stale: re-run `blogwright pds keygen`, commit, and release before logging in.

### `secret "<name>" has no OAuth session — run 'blogwright pds login'`

The key exists but no one has logged in yet (keygen also clears any previous session, since client auth is bound to the key). Run the interactive bootstrap:

```sh
blogwright pds login --identifier <handle-or-did>
```

It prints an authorize URL; approve in a browser, then paste the full `/oauth/callback` URL back — query string and all (`that was not a URL — paste the full callback address, query string and all` means the pasted text didn't parse as one).

### `the stored OAuth session is no longer valid (refresh tokens expire after 180 idle days, and rotation races invalidate them) — re-run 'blogwright pds login'`

Refresh tokens are single-use and rotated on every sync; a session lapses if nothing syncs for 180 days, or if a rotation race invalidated the stored token. Re-run `blogwright pds login` to establish a fresh session — nothing else is lost.

:::note
When this happens during the automatic post-deploy sync, the deploy itself is unaffected: you see `pds sync failed (deploy unaffected): …` as a warning, and the next deploy after you log in re-reconciles everything.
:::

### `pds sync publishes canonical production URLs and refuses to run for "<env>"`

`pds sync` writes records containing your production URLs, so it only runs for the `production` environment — it also runs automatically after every successful production deploy. Don't pass a non-production env to it.

### `src/data/atproto.json is not initialised — run 'blogwright pds init' first`

Sync needs the committed site files that `pds init` writes: `src/data/atproto.json` (by default) and `public/.well-known/site.standard.publication`. A related error — `… does not match … — re-run 'blogwright pds init'` — means the two files disagree about the publication URI; re-running `pds init` rewrites them consistently. If instead the message is `session DID <did> does not match <atprotoJson> DID <did>`, you are logged in with a different account than the one that owns the publication.

### `secret "<name>" holds app-password credentials — app passwords are no longer supported; run 'blogwright pds keygen' then 'blogwright pds login'`

The secret still holds the pre-OAuth `{ identifier, password }` shape. `pds keygen` is the migration entry point: it replaces the legacy value with the OAuth client key, and `pds login` establishes the session.

### `<n> PDS record(s) have no local post (rkeys: …) — not deleted; remove them manually if intended`

A warning after sync: records exist on the PDS with no matching local post — usually posts you deleted or whose slugs changed. Sync never deletes records; remove the orphans manually (with a PDS client) if that is what you intended. Post slugs must not change after publication — the rkey is derived from the URL (see the [rkey reference](/reference/rkey/)).
